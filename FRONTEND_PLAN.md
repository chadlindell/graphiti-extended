# Graphiti MCP Frontend Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for building the frontend of Graphiti MCP, a web interface for interacting with the Graphiti backend. The frontend will be built using React + Vite, focusing on creating an intuitive and responsive user interface for graph visualization and management.

- [x] Initialize React + Vite project
- [ ] Set up essential dependencies:
  - React Router for navigation
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - D3.js or Cytoscape.js for graph visualization
  - Axios for API communication
  - React Query for state management
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Configure build and deployment scripts

## 2. Core Components Development (Phase 2)
### Authentication Components
- [ ] Login form
- [ ] Registration form
- [ ] Password reset
- [ ] Auth context and hooks

### Layout Components
- [ ] Main application layout
- [ ] Navigation bar
- [ ] Sidebar for tools and options
- [ ] Footer

### Graph Visualization Components
- [ ] Graph canvas component
- [ ] Node visualization
- [ ] Edge visualization
- [ ] Graph controls (zoom, pan, center)
- [ ] Node/edge styling options

## 3. Feature Implementation (Phase 3)
### Graph Management
- [ ] Create new graph
- [ ] Import graph data
- [ ] Export graph data
- [ ] Save/load graph layouts

- [ ] Delete edges
- [ ] Edge styling
- [ ] Edge filtering

### Analysis Tools
- [ ] Path finding
- [ ] Graph metrics
- [ ] Centrality measures
- [ ] Community detection
- [ ] Custom queries

## 4. Advanced Features (Phase 4)
### Collaboration Features
- [ ] Real-time collaboration
- [ ] User permissions
- [ ] Sharing capabilities
- [ ] Version history

### Data Integration
- [ ] Import from various data sources
- [ ] Export to different formats
- [ ] API integration
- [ ] Custom data transformations

### Visualization Enhancements
- [ ] Multiple layout algorithms
- [ ] Custom styling templates
- [ ] Animation controls
- [ ] Mini-map
- [ ] Advanced filtering

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance (Phase 5)
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## 6. Documentation and Deployment (Phase 6)
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Component documentation
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: 1 week
2. Phase 2: 2 weeks
3. Phase 3: 3 weeks
4. Phase 4: 2 weeks
5. Phase 5: 1 week
6. Phase 6: 1 week

Total estimated time: 10 weeks

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 1 setup
